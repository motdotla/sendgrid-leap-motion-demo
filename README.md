# sendgrid-leap-motion-demo

Bit of code integrating Leap Motion and SendGrid for demo purposes.

## Approach

Cmd + F1

I'm with a little startup called SendGrid.

API Company

We make it super simple to send and receive email from your applications.

Turn-key solution. 

Password reset. Alert/notification emails.

I'm going to show you just how easy it is.

I have this leap motion here. 

It's a device used to capture natural movements.

For example, I have this little node script here that captures when I draw a circle.

Show them drawing the circle and the output in console.log.

Ok, cool, now let me show you how easy it is with our SendGrid API to add email to that.

That way you can draw the cirlce gesture and it send an email.

Live-code the sendgrid node module in, run the script, make the circle and send it.
